This can be useful in environments where censorship or surveillance is an issue.\n\n\nIt is important to note that relays can also be used for malicious purposes, such as sniffing or censoring network traffic.\n\n\nTherefore, it is important to carefully evaluate the use of relays and consider appropriate security measures to protect privacy and network security.",

To achieve the goal of a decentralized network, clients (e.g., Nostros) and relays (content servers) should actively cooperate. The Nostros resilience mode seeks first to raise awareness of this among users, and second to test new patterns and methods to improve the resilience of the network.\nA working implementation for this will soon be applied in Nostros.",
      "resilienceCategories": "Resilience exposure",

This tries to avoid both relays with too many events (centralization) and relays with almost no events (battery discharge).\n\nThe goal is to create a list of 5 relays that cover all contacts. However, if this is not possible, Nostros will search among other relays and warn the user about it.",

      "note_broadcasting": {
        "question": "Notes: broadcasting",
        "answer": "When a user posts a note or event in Nostr, that information is sent to the relay to which that user is connected. However, thanks to the note broadcasting feature, that information can be shared with other relays in the network so that it reaches a larger number of users. \n\nThis note broadcasting functionality helps the network and the relays to be more efficient and decentralized. By sharing the information with other relays, the workload and congestion on the network's servers are reduced, which improves performance and the network's ability to handle a larger number of users. Additionally, the decentralization of information makes Nostr more resilient to failures and harder to censor, as the information is distributed across multiple nodes in the network."
      },
      "notes_colouring": {
        "question": "Notes: coloring",
        "answer": "This feature displays a color bar next to the posts or notes displayed in the app. Each color represents a relay in which that note is present. \n\nUpon opening the detail of a note, you can see the information of the different relays where the note is located. This is done to give more visibility to the relays and highlight their importance in the Nostr network. \n\nBy displaying the information of the relays where the note is located, you can see how the information is transmitted through the Nostr network. In addition, by highlighting the importance of the relays, decentralization is encouraged and users are incentivized to connect to more servers in the network, which increases the efficiency and resiliency of the network."

      "resilient_login": {
        "question": "Access",
        "answer": "The 'resilient login' process consists of three steps that help make the network stronger and more decentralized. \n\n1. Connection to random relays \nYou will connect to 8 relays chosen at random from a pool of relays. Your user profile and relay list will be searched in these 8 relays. \n\n2. Search for contacts in your relay list \nDisconnect from the 8 random relays and connect to your relay list. Your contacts will be searched in this list. \n\n3. Search for your contacts' relays \nYou will see a list of the relays used by your contacts. You can add these relays to your list and connect to them, making the network more resilient."

      "what_are_zaps": {
        "question": "Zaps: What are they?",
        "answer": "Zaps are a type of tipping on the Lightning Network that enable fast, low-cost transmission of value. At their core, Zaps are tips that are sent over the Lightning Network with virtually no transaction fees. Previously, Lightning invoices were often included in the notes at the beginning of the Nostr protocol. However, with the implementation of NIP-57, Zaps have become the primary means of transmitting value in Nostr. \n\nNIP-57 is a document that specifies how Zaps should be implemented and introduces two new note types, namely type 9735 (Zap) and type 9734 (Zap request). These types of notes allow Nostr clients to request invoices from LNURL servers and pay them. \n\nIn addition, the NIP-57 specification explains how Lightning wallets receiving Zap payments should create notes to send to relays."

      "what_are_relays": {
        "question": "Relays: What are they?",
        "answer": "Relays serve as backend servers for Nostr, enabling clients to send messages that may or may not be stored and broadcasted to other connected clients. Given the rapid changes in the world of relays, it is likely that many changes will occur in the future.\n\nIt is important to note that Nostr is a decentralized system that relies on relays for data storage and retrieval. Therefore, if you experience sluggish performance on your Nostr client, it is likely due to the relays that you are using.\n\nAdding or removing relays to your client may be a worthwhile consideration."
      },
      "relays_paid_vs_free": {
        "question": "Relays: Free and paid relays",
        "answer": "There are public relays available, which offer a free onboarding service for the average user. However, the lack of cost to access and write to these relays attracts spammers and bot accounts. While some relay owners blacklist spam accounts, this is a reactive process that may not be enough to keep up with persistent spammers. \n\nAs Nostr scales, the volume of spam on public relays will increase. To combat this, users can migrate to their own relay or a paid relay to have more control over their feed and reduce unnecessary data downloads. Payment relays require a payment to access and maintain a high level of operation, resulting in a cleaner and more reliable feed. \n\nThere are several payment relay options available, with more being added regularly. To use a paid relay, users must contact the owner and pay to have their public key added to the whitelist. You can find paid relays on various websites, for example: https://nostr.watch/relays/find"

      "what_are_nips": {
        "question": "NIPs: What are they?",
        "answer": "Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) is a process that resembles the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) system, but it's less complex as it doesn't involve updating a network that holds billions of dollars in people's money. NIPs are designed to document the requirements, recommendations, and optional implementations for Nostr-compatible relay and client software. By referring to past NIPs, developers can ensure their tools remain compatible with the broader Nostr network. \n\nThe NIP process is a formal way for the Nostr community to propose ideas, suggest changes, and improve the protocol. Anyone can submit a NIP and receive feedback from community members, share code and examples, or provide testing methods for their idea. After a NIP transitions from the draft to the proposed phase, it can be withdrawn, rejected, or accepted. Accepted NIPs can be integrated into the code base of relays and clients that want to utilize the new features. \n\nThe Nostr protocol aims to be open, decentralized, and accessible to everyone. The NIP process supports transparency in community decision-making, encourages contributions, and facilitates building on the protocol."
